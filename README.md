# What is Comp Social?
Comp social is a social media app that aims to combine all your social media links together in one place so it is easier to give someone all of your social media links.

# Tech-Stack
1. Built using MERN stack
1. Tailwind is used on frontend
1. Express.js and mongodb are used in the backend

# Negatives
1. No encryption setup for passwords yet

# Setup
For now,
1. Do `npm i` for both frontend and backend directories.
1. Install mongodb
1. Run `npm start` in both frontend and backend directories to start both servers.

**The App should be available on localhost:3000/ in the browser**

Later when I learn docker,
***You might be able to use it with docker***
