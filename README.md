# What is Comp Social?
Comp social is a social media app that aims to combine all your social media links together in one place so it is easier to give someone all of your social media links.

# Tech-Stack
1. Built using MERN stack
1. Tailwind is used on frontend
1. Express.js and mongodb are used in the backend

# Negatives
1. No encryption setup for passwords

# Setup
For now,
1. Do `npm i` for both frontend and backend directories.
1. Install mongodb
1. Install nodemon by `sudo npm i -g nodemon`
1. Do `nodemon ./backend/index.js`
1. Do npm start inside frontend folder on another terminal

**The App should be available on localhost:3000/ in the browser**

Later,
***Might be available with docker once I learn docker***
